# Quick start

It is recommended to register an account on [our website](https://letoa.me/register) before starting any other steps.

## Invite the bot

To invite the bot to your server, go to [this link](https://letoa.me/bot) and choose your discord server.

## Configuring Settings

After inviting `Letoa`, you can see the server on your dashboard.

You can easily update the settings in the [`dashboard`](https://letoa.me/dashboard/), and you can update your account details as well.

Configuring settings with `Letoa` is pretty easy and is not confusing.

To start configuring your settings, head to the **Verification** settings tab. Here you can see mulitple settings including,

-   Verification Enabled ― This will enable / disable verification.
-   Verification Role ― The role the user will be provided with once they complete verification.
-   Logging Channel ― Logs will be sent here once a user completes verification or it fails to provide any roles.
